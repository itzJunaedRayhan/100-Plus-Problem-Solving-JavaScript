//  Task:
/*
Complete the code in the editor below. The variables i, d and s are already declared and initialized for you. You must:
Declare 3 variables: one of type int, one of type double, and one of type String.
Read 3 lines of input from stdin (according to the sequence given in the Input Format section below) and initialize your  variables.
Use the + operator to perform the following operations:
Print the sum of i plus your int variable on a new line.
Print the sum of d plus your double variable to a scale of one decimal place on a new line.
Concatenate s with the string you read as input and print the result on a new line.

let a = readLine();
let b = readLine();
let c = readLine();

console.log(parseInt(a) + parseInt(i));
console.log((parseFloat(b) + parseFloat(d)).toFixed(1));
console.log(s + c);
